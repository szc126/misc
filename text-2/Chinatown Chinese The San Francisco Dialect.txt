	Like any living organism, language is a growing phenomenon;
it is not static. Language is always affected by changes in environment
and progress, and the Chinese language is no exception.
As China became less isolated and more aware of her
Western counterparts, her language, along with her culture,
underwent significant changes. In the twentieth century, new
words such as "Marxism," "existentialism," "atom bomb," etc.,
inevitably entered the Chinese vocabulary. As a result, some
new Chinese words were coined according to the literal meaning
of the English terms. For example, existentialism was
directly translated into Chinese as 存在主義 (M) cunzai
zhuyi and atom bomb into 原子彈 (M) yuanzidan.[1] Other
Western terms, however, were transliterated, such as 邏輯
(M) luoji for logic and 馬克斯 (M) makesi for Marx. Because
of the variety that existed among dialects, the standardization
of these transliterations was often made more difficult. (For
example, chocolate could be 巧格力 (M) qiaogeli or
朱古力 (C) jyu-gu-lik and sofa could be 沙發 (M) shafa
or 梳化 (C) so-fa.) Of course, such language exchange is not

one way, as can be evidenced with English words such as
typhoon from the Chinese 颱風 (M) taifeng or kowtow from
叩頭 (M) koutou.

	The Chinese language continued to change when the Chinese
began to emigrate and settle in countries around the world.
In a different environment, the Chinese often found it necessary
to adapt their language to a foreign one, such as English,
and also to incorporate new language elements into their own.
After many years of language interchange, it was natural that
a new language neither purely Chinese nor English would evolve.

	An excellent example of such a language formation can be
seen in the Chinese spoken in various Chinatowns of the United
States. So different is the "Chinatown Chinese" from any Chinese
dialect, that a newly-arrived Chinese immigrant might
have a difficult time communicating with a Chinese American.
(For instance, 綠衣 (CC) luhk-yi is a policeman in America,
but to a person from Hong Kong or Taiwan, it would be a postman.)
One might first assume that such a language gap is dialectal
in origin because the majority of the Chinatown Chinese
speaks the Toishan dialect, not Putonghua (i.e., "Mandarin")
or the Guangzhou dialect (i.e., "Cantonese"). The problem is
dialectal only if one recognizes and accepts Chinatown Chinese
as one of the many dialects in the Chinese language, an idea
which is justifiable. For, in the Chinatown Chinese dialect, it
does not matter which dialect one speaks; he can communicate
with others in Chinatown as long as he is familiar with the
unique terminologies used in the Chinese language of America.

	It is not an easy task to study the Chinatown Chinese dialect.
The language is continually growing and changing as new
waves of educated Chinese immigrants and foreign students
enter the United States and add to the language. Unlike these
recent Chinese immigrants, the majority of the Chinese who
first came to America in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries were illiterate or semi-literate farmers and laborers
from the Toishan area of Guangdong Province in southeast
China. Upon facing a modern and industrialized society, they
had to improvise on their own to describe the new objects in
their environment. There was no systematic or conscious effort
to develop this new language; everything was passed down by
word-of-mouth. Even at this very moment, one term might be

in the process of being eliminated from the vocabulary, while
another might emerge to replace it or to conform to a change
in the environment. Hence the Chinatown Chinese vocabulary
is forever in flux.

	In order to better understand the Chinatown language, one
must examine some of the factors that make it both so dynamic
and at times inconsistent. These factors include such elements
as the particular locale of the Chinatown; the general time period;
the generation of Chinese; a person's community of friends
and associates; one's Chinese language background (Cantonese
or Toishan); and amount of formal education and exposure
to the English language.

	Locale: Of the many Chinese communities in the Western
hemisphere, the more well-known ones are in San Francisco
and New York City in America, and in Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada. Needless to say, each Chinatown environment
has developed its own distinct flavor and local idioms. For example,
foods such as barbecued pork buns are called 叉燒包
(CC) ta-siu-baau in many Chinatowns, but in Seattle, they are
more commonly known as 咸飽 (CC) haahm-baau. Thus, not
only is Chinatown Chinese a general dialect, but it can be further
subdivided according to locale.

	Time period and generation: As mentioned above, the early
Chinese immigrants were less educated and less Westernized
than the recent Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong or Taiwan
who come from more urban, industrialized centers. Consequently,
the language of the 1970s and 80s is adopted from
and is closer to that of the standardized Hong Kong and Taiwan
expressions which have slowly infiltrated the impromptu vocabulary
of the older Chinatown Chinese. For example, due to
the large number of new Hong Kong Cantonese immigrants
from the late sixties on, many Toishan Chinatown expressions
are slowly being replaced by Cantonese ones (e.g., to eat is
now 食飯 (C) sihk-faahn instead of 吃餐 (T) hyat-taan and
to drive is now 揸車 (C) ja-che or 駛車 (C) sai-che instead
of 放車 (T) fong-che). In addition, as the older generations
die, many carly Chinatown nicknames and idioms have become
obsolete for the younger generation (e.g., a San Francisco
department store named The Emporium is known as

十八國 (CC) sihp-baat-gok or "Eighteen Nations" but not
knowing the origins of the store, new immigrants know it as the "Big E").

	Chinese language background: Depending on whether one's
background is Cantonese or Toishan, terms for the same object
may differ. For example, vacuum cleaner is 吸塵機 (C) kap-
chahn gei and refrigerator is 雪櫃 (C) syut-gwai, but for a
Chinatown Toishan speaker not exposed to Hong Kong Cantonese,
the terms would be 吮塵偈 (T) dyut-chihn gaai and
霜櫃 (T) song-guih respectively. In many cases, such Toishan
expressions are preferred over Cantonese ones, even by Cantonese
speakers in Chinatown.

	Formal education: A more educated Chinese might translate
apartment in its more standard Chinese form 公寓 (M)
gongyu or (C) gung-yu. However, for the less formally educated
person, many urban and scientific terms might not be
familiar. He would resort to new or transliterated terms such
as 栢文 (CC) paak-muhn for apartment.

	Exposure to English: The more a person is exposed to the
English language, the more likely he would use transliterated
terms such as 夫列 (CC) fu-laat for flat and 市的 (CC) sih-dik
for steak. A person with less English contact or a newcomer
to the United States might say 「踏」樓 (C) daaph-lau or 牛扒/排
(C) ngauh-pa (M) niupai respectively. In some cases the idiom
of a person more familiar with English would reflect the English
word itself, like (CC) ti-wi for TV (television).

	Community of friends and associates: A person's group of
friends and associates may vary according to the generation,
class, and education. For example, a Cantonese speaker mixing
with Toishan workers might pick up a few Toishan words and
vice versa. Further, a person not familiar with English may
likely incorporate some transliterated terms into his own
vocabulary from a Westernized friend. In Chinatown Chinese,
depending on one's circle of friends, to see a movic, a common
activity, can be said in the following various ways: 睇畫

(T) hai wa; 睇戲 (C) tai hei; 睇 mu-fi (CC) hai mu-fi
("movie"); or 睇映畫 (CC) hai ying-wa.

	The following glossary provides an introduction and sampling
of Chinatown Chinese. It is divided into five sections: (1) transliterated
terms, (2) partially transliterated terms, (3) translated
terms, (4) new terms, and (5) special San Francisco terms. The
vocabulary is taken from the working class people of San Francisco
Chinatown, including all ages and both sexes. However,
it is limited to the pre-1970 period, before the National Origins
Quota System was abolished. This eliminates the influence
of the more educated and Westernized Chinese immigrants
whose language contribution to today's Chinatown Chinese
is from abroad and is not a product of living in America.
The transcription used for the characters follows the Toishan
dialect because that is the main one spoken by the Chinese
living in America. However, one must also be aware that even
the Toishan dialect has its variations (e.g., between city and
country dwellers, or between northern and southern Toishan
speakers) and that the pronunciations can even differ among
Toishan speakers depending on their home villages.[2] Hence,
the phonetic Chinatown Chinese transcriptions used here are
actually composites of basic Toishan pronunciations that are
commonly used and understood in Chinatown. In addition, it
should be noted that since Chinatown Chinese is influenced not
only by the Chinese dialects but also by English, there will be
times when terms defy written characters (e.g., (CC) ti-wi for
"TV"). And, there will be some cases in which a transliteration
is a combination of Toishan and Cantonese (e.g., the street
"Stockton" is often pronounced 士德頓 (CC) sih-dak-duhn)
in order to obtain a pronunciation closer to the English.

	How English affects the grammar and structure of Chinatown
Chinese should not be neglected. But since such changes vary
with the degree of one's exposure to English, they are extremely
inconsistent and are a matter of individual idiosyncrasy. Therefore,
this aspect of the language will not be dealt with here. In
any case, it is hoped that this glossary can provide insight on a
heretofore ignored language product of America which should
be ranked both as a new dialect of the Chinese language and
as an American ethnic dialect: Chinatown Chinese.[3]

1. Transliterated Terms

	Chinese transliterations are borrowed from standard Chinese
transliterations, e.g.: 沙文治 (M) shawenzhi (C) sa-mahn-jih
for "sandwich," 巴士 (M) bashi (C) ba-si for "bus," 的士高
(M) dishigao (C) dik-sih-gou for "disco," 紐約 (M) niuyue
(C) nau-yeuk for "New York," 福特 (M) fute (C) fuk-dahk for
"Ford," etc. However, Chinatown Chinese docs not always follow
standardized forms, especially with some proper names:
"Los Angeles" is 羅省 (CC) loh-saang, not 洛杉磯 (M)
luoshanji (C) lohk-chaam-gei; "Seattle" is 舍路 (CC) se-luh,
not 西雅圖 (M) xiyatu (C) sai-ngah-touh; "Detroit" is
積彩 (CC) dik-toi, not 底特律 (M) ditelü (C) daai-dahk-
leut; "Nixon" is 匿遜 (CC) nik-seun, not 尼克遜 (M)
nikesun (C) neih-haak-seun; etc. Since the former case is not
an American-based creation, examples from it will not be listed
here. For convenience, terms in this section have been divided
into: (A) place names, (B) San Francisco street names, (C) food
terms, and (D) miscellaneous terms.

2. Partially Transliterated Terms

	With the acceptance of many American terms into the Chinatown
Chinese vocabulary, it is only natural that these terms
would also function like regular Chinese words. Another result
is the formation of partially transliterated terms, part of which
are in Chinese and a part in English. In this section, and hereafter,
those English terms transliterated into Chinese are
italicized. The following are a few such examples:

backyard
	mi-ya
	尾 ya

beef stew
	ngauh sih-du
	牛市都
cable car
	ding-dong ka or
	叮噹卡
	dong-dong ka
	噹噹卡
clubhouse sandwich
	wuih-so sa-muhn-jih
	會所沙文治
color TV
	ngahn-sik ti-wi
	顏色 ti-wi
to dance (lit: to leap
a dance)
	hiuh daan-sihng
	跳旦繩
frying pan
	dyan baan
	煎 baan
gas stove
	ge-sih luh
	ge-sih 爐
lamb stew
	yeng sih-du
	羊市都
nylon stockings
	naai-laan maaht
	naai-laan 襪
streetcar
	gaai ka
	街卡
street fair (carnival)
	gaaih fe
	街 fe

There is another interesting group of partially transliterated
examples. All of these are actually fully transliterated except
that in addition they are modified by Chinese terms which
either repeat or describe what they are:

bank
(bank + house)
	beng-fohng
	beng 房
buffet
(buffet + meal)
	bu-fi-taan
	布腓餐
can
(can + Chinese noun suffix)

	kin 頭

(kid + Chinese noun diminutive)
	kit-doi
	kit 仔

4. New Terms

New terms are those that are created out of the Chinese
American experience. In other words, these terms emerged in
the speeches of the Chinese Americans as a result of living in
America. It should also be noted that many of these words
derive from the Toishan dialect. This section has examples

(E) household terms; (F) employment terms, (G) terms used

B. Sayings

1. "Water splashing at the ship's bow."
	船頭水嚮
	syuohn-hauh sui heng
	Re: The ocean trip to China, depicting a person sleeping at the bow
	of the ship and listening to the sound of waves on his way home.
2. "Manion's coming!"
	Min-yin 來啦
	min-yin loih la
	Re: Inspector Jack Manion (d. 1959), the unofficial chief of police
	of Chinatown and the authoritative figure during the tong wars.
	This little phrase was used to scare off children who had been
	naughty.
3. "Cook arrowhead roots for every meal."
	餐餐煮茨菇
	taan-taan ji si-guh
	This is also a transliterated nickname for San Francisco. "si-guh"
	(Sagittaria sagittifolia) is a very popular water plant caten by Cantonese
	and Toishan people, and is usually served around Chinese
	New Year. Since this water plant was very expensive and difficult to
	obtain in America, it was said that to eat it every day in America
	would be an almost impossible task. The significance and meaning
	of this saying is unclear, but we speculate that it is tied to the
	belief that San Francisco represents a hope for wealth and happiness.
	Going to San Francisco would be like eating si-guh every day
	(i.e., happy days and happy times will come one day).
4. "Come to America and suffer like a mule."
	來金山挨騾仔
	loih gim-saan ngaih luih-doi
	This bitter statement coined by the many Chinese immigrants is
	self-explanatory.
5. "Eat more potatoes and go back to China.
	吃多 naai 薯仔返唐山
	hyat o naai sih-doi faahn hohng-saan
	This is another bitter statement telling the Chinese to work hard
	and to eat more potatoes so that they can save enough money to
	return home. Potatoes is used here to emphasize the fact that
	potatoes are less expensive than rice, do not taste good, and are a
	foreign substitute for the Chinese diet.
6. "China boy, how often do you go back and forth? Now that you're
back, you break the teacup."
	唐山仔，幾久唔來回，回來就打爛個茶杯仔
	hohng-saan doi, gi-giu mh loih-wuih, wuih-loih diu a laahn go
	chah-bui-doi
	This is a children's ditty, poking fun at the China-born Chinese for
	being so shy and nervous in a new environment (i.e., America).
	Breaking anything is also a bad omen.
	Variation: "China boy, how often do you go back and forth? When
	you do come back, your ass is full of moss."
	唐山仔，幾久唔來回，回來屎「忽」生青苔
	hohng-saan doi, gi-giu mh loih-wuih, wuih-loih si-fut saang
	teng-hoih
	Here, the ditty pokes fun at how long the China-born Chinese has
	been away from home.
7. "Ring, ring, ring. Gong Cheong Lung of San Francisco. No more lice,
no more eat. All will drop dead."
	Wuhng, wuhng, wuhng. 大埠廣昌隆。No mo lai-si, no mo yit,
	o-loh aap daai-dit.
	Wuhng, wuhng, wuhng. Aai-fyauh gong-tyang-luhng. No mo lai-si,
	no mo yit, o-loh aap daai-dit.
	There are two popular versions to this ditty. The first three words
	are onomatopoetic, representing the sound of dialing a telephone.
	Gong Cheong Lung is the name of a San Francisco store that used
	to be the only Chinese store for the community. One version says
	when this store was first established, it did not register with the city
	government and did not obtain a license for business. Someone notified

	the store about this and upset the manager. In broken English,
	he hurriedly called City Hall saying the above, which meant,
	"This is Gong Cheong Lung. We do not have a license. Without it we cannot
	eat (i.e., make a living) and we will all die." Another version says
	this ditty was used to poke fun at the Chinese people who lived in
	small towns away from San Francisco Chinatown and who would
	become frantic whenever they run out of rice. Since Gong Cheong
	Lung was the only store where rice could be bought, it was only
	natural that these people would call the store and in their broken
	English say, "Gong Cheong Long! We have no more rice and cannot
	eat, so we will all die." The difference in the two versions is attributed
	to the word "lai-si" which can mean "license" in one story and
	"rice" in another.

NOTES
	1. The Chinese language is divided into many dialects that are further
subdivided according to regions or villages. The official language of China
is Putonghua (more popularly known as "Mandarin"). However, the main
Chinese dialect spoken in Chinese American communities is that of Toishan,
which is a subdialect of Guangzhouhua (more popularly known as "Cantonese")
and which also has its own subdivisions. The following notations
will be used to indicate which dialect is being transcribed: M = Mandarin,
C = Cantonese, T = Toishan dialect, and CC = Chinatown Chinese (based on
Toishan pronunciations).
	2. For more details on the variations within the Toishan dialect see: Tung
Yiu, "The Tai-shan Dialect," Ph.D. dissertation, Princeton University, 1946;
and Chao Yuan-ren, "On the Linguistics Materials of Tai-Shan, Kwangtung"
[written in Chinese], Bulletin of The Institute of History and Philology,
Academia Sinica 23, pt. 1 (Dec. 1951): 25-76. Although Tung's work is
based on New York Chinatown and Chao's on San Francisco Chinatown,
they do not deal directly with the unique Chinatown Chinese terminologies.
	3. The original research for this paper was done in 1969 for a Chinese linguistics
seminar at San Francsico State University. Although it has never
been published, it has been privately circulated. Subsequently, other works
have touched upon Chinatown Chinese: Huang Xuanfan, "Jiujinshan Huafou
Taishan yuliao" [The. Toishan Language of San Francisco's Chinatown],
Guangdong wenxian jikan 1, no. 4 (December 1971): 100; and Kexi, "Mantan
Beimei Huaqiao duiyu diming di Zhong yi" [Comments on How Place
Names Are Translated into Chinese by the North American Chinese],
Guangdong wenxian jikan 4, no. 2 (June 1974): 65-66. These works are
casual observations made by Chinese travelers in America.
